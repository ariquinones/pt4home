A physical therapy web app for better healthcare communication between a patient and their physical therapist. Building an at home exercise treatment regimen for a patient to better assist them in their recovery journey.
Advantage Journey allows better communication between a patient and their physical therapist, giving the patient a better experience while they recover from injury. This app focuses on a niche market for a better patient journey experience in the physical therapy industry that has not been there before. Most patients can only attend physical therapy once a week due to time and budget constraints. With Advantage Journey a patient has exercises for every day of the week sent to them by their own physical therapist for a faster recovery from injury.
